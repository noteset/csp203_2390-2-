Here’s a fun fact: Spacesuits take longer to make than a space mission!

Creating a NASA spacesuit can take as long as 5 years and cost up to $20 million each. This is because they’re essentially mini spacecraft—built to withstand extreme temperatures, provide oxygen, and even resist micrometeorites. The suits used on the Apollo missions to the Moon, for example, had 21 layers of material! Modern suits are even more advanced, allowing astronauts to survive in the harsh vacuum of space and maneuver outside the International Space Station for hours at a time.
